## Description
Fitness Time is a very basic single page web application at this point, that utilizes a Rails API backend with postgresql database and a Javascript frontend. A fitness studio, or in this case a dance studio, can add dance classes that get displayed on the page, can be edited, or deleted. 

## Installation
To initiate the API please see instructions in the backend repo. Once the rails server is running, from the fitness_time_frontend directory in your terminal, run `open index.html` to run the web application.
